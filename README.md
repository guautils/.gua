### I try to update this Repo regularly, but cant promise the impossible.

# ![What is Bonny?](./imgs/what-is.svg)
`bonny` is my own UI library, that i am gonna use in future projects. 

I wanna try to make it as optimized and lightweight as i possibly can.<br>But i probably will fail at some points or another.
